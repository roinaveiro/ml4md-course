# molecular_diffusion
This folder contains only one item:  The jupyter notebook for the test of molecular diffusion.   The code in the notebook is based on "Equivariant Diffusion for Molecule Generation in 3D" by Emiel Hoogeboom, Victor Garcia Satorras, Clement Vignac and Max Welling, https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17003.pdf

The notebook is a guide to various parts of the source code. To follow this you should download the source from github https://github.com/ehoogeboom/e3_diffusion_for_molecules. 99% of the code here comes from the repository. it has only been modified so that it will work in the notebook. run the notebook from the main directory.

There are four parts to this notebook.

loading the dataset and visualizing molecules from qm9

Testing a molecule for stablity

Demonstration of the Equivariance of the Model

Denoising a random sample based on the trianed model and visualizing the chain and creating a movie.
